## How many loc should a mature developer deliver a day

---   
When I first saw this title, the first thing that came to my mind was an article I read on [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/) about which time of day the code output was the highest for all bosses. While productivity varies greatly, each of these gurus writes at least 300 lines of code in a given day.
**In my opinion, 300 is a reasonable number.**

### My Reasons

- ##### We shouldn't write too many loc every day
   In my opinion, a programmer does not have a large amount of code output to become strong, the code is actually just the statement that we tell the computer to perform the task. What really matters is the kernel and the idea. Code can be either unnutritious dross or mathematical gold. It is the most valuable process to learn theories, integrate ideas, summarize what you have and translate it into code. However, the preparation before writing code must be long and hard, requiring us to consult a lot of materials and do a lot of thinking.

- ##### We shouldn't write too little loc every day
   A programmer is a multilingual occupation that often involves dealing with computers in all sorts of ways. If you write less than ten lines of code every day, not only will your proficiency in various languages decline, but it also proves that the programmer does not think much, does not make much effort, and just loves to hang out.

### Conclusion
Every mature developer doesn't have to hand in exactly 300 lines of code a day, it's just a number of dials, it's the quality of the code, the idea behind the code, etc. These are to go through constant learning and efforts. After all,
**We are developers. We use our minds to change the world**
